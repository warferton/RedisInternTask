# RedisInternTask

Two applications: Data setter and Data Reciever for redis server, without exe's. Plus their SRC folders, named accoedingly.
                  Apps dont implement the RedisMap() as it is not done, due to the deadline(Thought I just had make apps communicate data to and from the Redis Server with no loss).

The RedisMap class, or at least a smth that looks like a class.
